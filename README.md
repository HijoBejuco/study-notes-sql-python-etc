## Python decorators
A decorator is a function that modifies the behavior of another function or method. Can be created using @ and they are used for code reuse and to add general functionalities to methods/functions.

The following code shows how to create a simple decorator which only calculates how much time takes to excecute a function. 

```python
import time

# Creating decorator
# The decorator recieves a function as parameter
def timer_decorator(func): 
    # wrapper envuelve la funciÃ³n original, y toma cualquier numero de 
    # argumentos y parÃ¡metros para poder recibir cualquier funciÃ³n y 
    # ejecutarla adentro suyo.
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {elapsed_time:.4f} seconds to complete")
        # wrapper returns the result of the original function.
        return result
    # timer_decorator returns the wrapper function
    return wrapper

# decorating the function
@timer_decorator
def example_function(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i
    return total

# Calling decorated function
result = example_function(1000000)
print(f"Result: {result}")
```
#### Explaining code of decorators
timer_decorator returns the wrapper function (**returns the reference to wrapper**), but do not calls it. This means that we can create a variable to assign to the timer_decorator and consequently use that variable as it was the wrapper function. 

For example, in the following code, we assing timer_decorator to a variable called "var" and then we can use "var" as it was the function wrapper. 

```python
var = timer_decorator(example_function)
print(var(4))
```

When we apply a decorator to a function using the @, it is equivalent to do the following: 
```python
example_function = timer_decorator(example_function) 
```
Here we assign to the variable "example_function", the new functionalities of the decorator, so this means that after the function is decorated, when we use the example_function function, **WE ARE CALLING THE *wrapper* function** instead of the original one. 



## Arrays in bigquery and sql

### ARRAY_AGG:
This is an Aggregating function, so it aggregates all the values using a group by clause. It takes different rows and transform them into a single row of ARRAY datatype. 






















## Statistics

### **causal inference and causation**


* Machine learning is based on *predictive inference*, which is very different from causal inference. The first one is based on correlation and the other on causation.
* But ML can be used in some cases as a tool for studying causalities (Causal ML)

#### **Predictive inference:**
Prediction based on correlations like ML, here we predict something, based on the values of other variables. Here the objective is to predict the objective variable the best we can. 

#### **Causal inference:**
aims to measure the value of the outcome when you change the value of something else, everything else equal. 

Here the quality of the prediction is not the most important objective, it's possible to have a valid causal model, with low predictive power, because it can just explain a little variance of the phenomena. 

**Counterfactual:** is the world where we don't make the intervention, so we can compare both worlds (the one with intervention and the one without)
* The comparison with the 2 worlds is the **Causal effect**

**Counterfactual example**
* Imagine you have a headache, then you take a pill, and after a while, the headache is gone. But was it because the pill? or something else like a tea or a bottle of water? Its impossible to know which factor or combination of factors helped as all those effects are confounded. The only way to answer this perfectly, would be to have two parallel worlds, where in one you take the pill and in the other dont. *As the pill is the only difference between the two situations*, it would allow you to claim that it was the cause. But obviously, we do not have parallel worlds to play with. In causal inference, we call this: ***The fundamental problem of causal inference***.

## Deep learning

### The linear unit
This is the fundamental component of a NN. The individual neuron. A neuron with one input looks like: 
![individual neuron](images/individual_neuron.png)
The input is x,the connection to the network has a weighy w, whenever the input flows through a connection, the value is multiplied by the weight. A NN "learns" by modifying its weights.

**b** is a special weight called the bias, this has not any input., thats why, The bias enables the neuron to modify the output independently of it's inputs. 

**y** is the output of the neuron. The neuron sums up all the values it recieves through its connections. The neuron's activation is: ***y=wx+b*** (This is just the equation of a line)

### Chain rule and backpropagation

Here are some notes on how to perform Backpropagation when a Neural network is being optimized

### RAG Retrieval Augmented Generation
* The motivations for RAG is to feed an LLM with private data, so it has a better understanding of a specific topic.

## Gunicorn
Gunicorn is a program that handles receiving requests from users on the internet (like when you open a web page) and passes those requests to an application written in Python (for example, a website that was programmed in Python).

Then, the Python application generates a response (such as displaying a web page) and Gunicorn takes care of sending it back to the user.

Why do you need Gunicorn? When you program something in Python, it normally runs from the terminal (console), and only you can use it. If you want others to be able to use your program (for example, through a web browser or an API), you need a server that listens to user requests and communicates with your application. This is where Gunicorn comes into play.

Gunicorn is the bridge that allows anyone to access your Python application through a browser or a mobile app, instead of only from your computer.

Real-life example: Imagine you have a small store. You are the one in charge of receiving customers and attending to their orders, but you can only help one person at a time. If more people arrive, you canâ€™t assist them all at once.

Now, Gunicorn would be like hiring a team of employees (called "workers") who help you attend to several people at the same time, which makes your store run better and faster, even if a lot of people show up.

Your Python program is the store. Gunicorn is the team of employees that helps the store run smoothly and serve many customers at the same time. The customers are the users who want to access your website or application.

What happens without Gunicorn? If you donâ€™t use something like Gunicorn and simply run your Python program in basic mode, only one person at a time would be able to use your application. This is fine if only you are using it, but it wonâ€™t work for most web applications that need to serve many people at once.

Summary: Gunicorn is like a "server" that makes your Python application available for others to use, just like a website. It helps your application run efficiently, even when many people are trying to access it at the same time. If in the future youâ€™re developing an application or service in Python and want it to be available to many people, Gunicorn allows you to do this in a simple and efficient way.
